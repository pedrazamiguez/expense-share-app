     * **Why we always restore non-SYNCED statuses (even for items in the remote set):**
     * Firestore's `MetadataChanges.INCLUDE` fires snapshots that include pending
     * local writes (latency compensation). These items appear in the remote set
     * but have NOT been confirmed by the server. If we skip restoration for items
     * in the remote set, the upsert's default SYNCED status would overwrite
     * PENDING_SYNC — hiding the sync indicator. The PENDING_SYNC → SYNCED
     * transition is handled exclusively by the repository's explicit
     * `updateSyncStatus()` call after server confirmation (via
     * `confirmPendingSyncWithdrawals()` or the sync in `addWithdrawal()`).
